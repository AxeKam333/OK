Projects made for Combinatorial Optimization (Optymalizacja Kombinatoryczna) in 3 semester.

Main tasks performed:
Selecting a combinatorial problem to solve: TSP. Independently designed and implemented an algorithm, based on metaheuristics. Simulated annealing was chosen. The project must also implement an efficient instance generator. Preparation of a report.
